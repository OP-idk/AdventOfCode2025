# Owen Parsley: Advent of Code 2025 Solutions

## Language 
I decided to use Java not because it's neccessarily the best choice for most 
of these challenges, but because it's the language my current computer science 
class uses and I didn't think it would be a very good idea to get myself used 
to programming in a different language right before finals week 😅

I'm thinking I might come back and port my solutions to rust or another 
language next quarter as a warm up for whatever project I end up doing since I 
won't be taking any actual programming classes
